Client Machine: Initiates the file transfer by choosing to send a file, specifying the server's IP and port, and sending the file.

Server Machine: Listens for incoming connections, accepts them, receives file details and data, and saves the file to disk.

Arrows: Show the direction of data flow between the client and server.


To access and run your file transfer project, follow these step-by-step instructions:

### 1. **Setting Up the Server**:
   - **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt** on the machine you want to act as the server.
   - **Navigate to the Project Directory** using `cd path/to/your/project`.
   - **Run the Python Script**:
     ```bash
     python server.py
      python client.py
     ```
   - **Choose to Start as Server**:
     - When prompted, type `s` and press **Enter**.
     - Enter a port number (e.g., `12345`) and press **Enter**.
   - The server will start listening for incoming connections.

### 2. **Sending a File from the Client**:
   - **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt** on the machine you want to act as the client.
   - **Navigate to the Project Directory** using `cd path/to/your/project`.
   - **Run the Python Script**:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - **Choose to Send a File**:
     - When prompted, type `f` and press **Enter**.
   - **Enter Server Details**:
     - Input the server's **IP address** and the **port number** (e.g., `192.168.1.5`, `12345`).
   - **Enter the Filename**:
     - Provide the full path or name of the file you wish to send and press **Enter**.
   - The client will start the transfer, and both machines will display success messages upon completion.

### **Visual Access Guide**:
- **Server**:
  - Terminal display will show `[*] Listening on port 12345`.
  - When a connection is accepted, it will display `[*] Accepted connection from (IP Address, Port)` and the progress of the file transfer.
- **Client**:
  - Terminal prompts the user to enter the server's IP, port, and file path.
  - Displays `filename sent successfully` when the transfer completes.
